## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Vector store not initialized"**:
   - Ensure the PDF file is in the correct location: `data/ncert_science_class8.pdf`
   - Check that the filename is exactly `ncert_science_class8.pdf` (not misspelled)
   - Verify sufficient disk space for vector storage

2. **"Google API key error"**:
   - Verify your Google API key is correctly set in the `.env` file
   - Ensure the key has access to Gemini AI and text-embedding-004
   - Check API quota and billing status

3. **"LangSmith API key not set"**:
   - This is optional. If you do not provide `LANGCHAIN_API_KEY`, LangSmith monitoring and tracing will be disabled, but the app will still work fully.

4. **"Audio input not working"**:
   - Check microphone permissions in your browser
   - Ensure you're using a supported browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
   - Verify streamlit-mic-recorder installation

5. **"Knowledge base initialization failed"**:
   - Check the PDF file is not corrupted
   - Verify sufficient disk space for vector storage
   - Check ChromaDB permissions and directory access

6. **"Conversation history issues"**:
    - Clear conversation and restart if needed
